## To Do

* I concentrated on the logic and not so much the layout, so still need to sample colours and measure elements in the PDF for exactness
* Add Aria 
* Create an env var to use in [get-medal-data.ts](./src/lib/get-medal-data.ts) that can be used in both dev and prod to point to the mock data/API endpoint
